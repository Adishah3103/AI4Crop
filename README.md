### Crop disease detection and remedy suggestion using Deep learning and Android

#### Description: 
The application aims to detects the plant disease from the snapshot of the plant leaf. The farmer has to just capture the plant leaf image from our app on his mobile. The app will send this image to our AI system. The AI system will then accurately detect the disease if any, present on the plant and report it to the farmer.

#### Highlight:
 Created a deep learning model from scratch with 96% accuracy which is trained over 10,000 different images of healthy and diseased plants. Once the model is deployed, it is ready for large scale agricultural use.
 
 #### Future scope: 
 Future enhancements can be integrated into the project which can make it a complete one step AI solution to smart farming. Apart from detection and remedy of the disease, an AI system can be developed to predict how fast the disease can spread over the farm, what are the necessary steps to reduce it, best pesticides/ fertilizers and weather suitable for a particular crop, etc.
